    "## Brief Overview of Seaborn\n",
    "Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and tightly integrated with the Pandas data structures. It makes it easy to create complex and aesthetically pleasing visualizations with just a few lines of code. Seaborn also comes with several built-in themes and color palettes to make your plots look more professional."

    "## Differences Between Seaborn and Matplotlib\n",
    "- **Ease of Use**: Seaborn simplifies the process of creating common visualizations, whereas Matplotlib requires more code for the same tasks.\n",
    "- **Built-in Themes**: Seaborn comes with built-in themes for styling your plots, while Matplotlib requires manual customization.\n",
    "- **Statistical Plots**: Seaborn includes support for complex statistical plots such as violin plots, box plots, and heatmaps, which are either not available or more complex to implement in Matplotlib.\n",
    "- **DataFrame Support**: Seaborn works seamlessly with Pandas DataFrames, allowing for easier data manipulation and plotting."
